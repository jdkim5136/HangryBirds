## What is HangryBirds?
Our game is a 3D version of the popular mobile game Angry Birds. The player will be in control of a cannon that can be aimed using the IJKL keys. By hitting Q, the player can launch a bird from the cannon into the structure to eat the food.
- If the bird hits a box, the box breaks.
- If the bird hits a chocolate, the game ends and you lose.
- If the bird hits the seed, it will eat the seed.
The goal of the game is to eat all the seeds.

## Interactivity
